flavortext[11]="To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Hideous Destructor, The gameplay is extremely complicated, and without a solid training in it's separate bootcamp level addon most of the enemies will kick your ass and make you bleed out, There's also the game's nihilistic plot, which deftly woven into the messages of the game - the lore's mythology draws heavily from H.P. Lovecraft, for instance, The fans understand this stuff; they have the intelectual capacity to truly appreciate the depth of it's horror, to realize it isn't just a hard tactical mod - it says something deep about EXISTANCE. As consequence people who dislike Hideous Destructor ARE idiots- ofcourse they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the realism in the mod's weapons, which themselves are a cryptic reference to real life military  tactics employed by US Marine Force I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons bleeding out in-game as Matt's genius unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them And yes, by the way, I DO have a Liberator tattoo, And no, you cannot see it, it's for the ladies' eyes only- and even they have to demostrate they're withing 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand._"
