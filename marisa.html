   <!-- If you are seeing this, then you really shouldn't. This page is dedicated to not only Marisa but also for her statement. But if you insist, the text below is what drives me to make this page in the first place. -->

   <!-- So, this page. I made it solely for hoping that more people will reach out into the truth of what really happened. Honestly, I'm really scared to show myself that I have ties with Marisa. She *is* my friend, since 2022. Historically speaking, I approached to her first by the time I went into her server, although not interacting much until the whole fiasco at March this year (2023). When that happened, that's when I really started to talk to her. She's a nice gal, allowing me to use some of her code from her mods with permission. Hell, the boykisser screen in this website and from my weapon pack are from her, and that is a recent thing in Codename: DEMOLITIONIST. I was mentally shocked, knowing that she contributed to a lot of coding in GZDoom. The linetrace function ARE from her, for instance (if I recall correctly). I withheld myself from doing this, knowing that I made friends that, not only they're the side of ousting her (most likely unaware about her statement), but also some are also trans and/or have their own problems. Two other reasons why I decided to make this webpage is that I found out that I'm ended up on a site notorious for harassing people to death in a screenshot from Marisa's server, and my mind just, decided to do this out of instinct. I'm scared. -->
