    <p>There isn't anything much here yet. Come back to it later!</p>

    <p>All of the mods from here are for <a href=https://codeberg.org/mc776/HideousDestructor style="text-decoration:none;color:lime;">Hideous Destructor</a>, a gameplay mod for GZDoom.</p>

    <a>Instead of mod descriptions from what you would normally see from my mod releases in the Hideous Destructor Discord, all of the writing for the mods are my personal thoughts in retrospect.</a>

    <p>The mods are listed here from oldest to newest. Each collapsible represents the year the mods were released.</p>

<summary>PAIMON RATION</summary>
<p style="color:yellow">Requires <a href=https://github.com/Caligari87/Ugly-as-Sin style="color:yellow;">Ugly as Sin</a></p>
<p>First release: August 16, 2021</p>
<p>Latest release: September 3, 2021</p>

<p>The first addon that I made for Hideous Destructor, a joke addon for Ugly as Sin. This was made out from a joke from an RPG game called Genshin Impact about Paimon being called an emergency food. No one actually made it into a lieral thing, that I took matters into my own hands and made this one.</p>

<p>Loadout code is: ehe</p>

<summary>THE PACIFIST (STANDALONE)</summary>
<p style="color:yellow">This mod is <span style="color:red">no longer updated</span> standalone. It's now in the Renegade's Gun Shop weapon pack.</p>
<p>First release: September 5, 2021</p>
<p>Latest release (Standalone): September 6, 2021</p>

<p>The second addon and the first weapon addon that is a 7mm medium machine gun. This was me making an attempt to make the M60 into Hideous Destructor, but ended up being a kindof a different weapon, unaware that there is a 7mm lmg from Potetobloke's Bangers and Mash weapon pack. The safe/fire firemode selector is the result of me trying to make the gun semi/auto but ended up having the semi mode to not fire at all, and, I just leave it there for whatever reason 2021 me had in store.</p>

<p>When I was making my weapon pack, I thought of reworking this as an automatic grenade launcher since nobody has made one yet. Not to mention that the M60 actually exists now in Bangers and Mash.</p>

<p>Loadout codes for the gun and mag are PAC and 7MG respectively.</p>

<p>NOTE: This build is a machine gun, the currently maintained one is an automatic grenade launcher.</p>
